# EpiExigesis
AngelHack 2019 Project!
Rapid visualization of mutual exposures among individual, individuals to groups, and group to group, and the total population.

Discovery of epidemic patterns is extremely difficult because of the latency between cause and effect, the complexity of interactions between the agents, then prioritizing and evaluating the most significant parts. We provide a tool that finds 'hotspots' in time, space and groupings using a Mutual Exposure scoring to rank and compare the relative risks and allows slicing by agent, time, and place.
